            a. Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on [Temu+]'s website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only.

Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or v. Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.
            b. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by [Temu+] at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

        The materials on [Temu+]'s website are provided on an 'as is' basis. [Temu+] makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

            4. Limitations
            In no event shall [Temu+] or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on [Temu+]'s website, even if [Temu+] or a [Temu+] authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
